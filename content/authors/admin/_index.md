I am an Astrophysicist working to understand the beahaviour of Black Hole Horizons in dynamical situations, often in binary merger setting, their strong field gravitational effects and how they affect they affect the gravitational radiation we receive in our detectors, by Numerically solving Einstein's equations of General Relativity using Supercomputers. I also research and develop novel accelerated techniques for gravitational wave inference, using a variety of tools, from singal processing, Bayesian Inference and Stochastic Sampling. I also study the quality and performance of gravitational waveform produced by different models that directly impact our ability to accurately discern the source properties.I enjoy find novel solutions to problems by writing codes are optimized and efficient.
