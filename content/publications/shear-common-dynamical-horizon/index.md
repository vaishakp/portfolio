summary: Connects shear dynamics at the common horizon to features in the emitted gravitational
  radiation.
abstract: This paper studies the shear of the outer common dynamical horizon in BBH mergers and
  how it tracks the waveform seen at future null infinity. By introducing an area-based time parametrization
  on the horizon, the authors find a strong correlation between horizon shear features and the
  gravitational strain, across several mergers. The framework provides a concrete map between
  strong-field horizon dynamics and asymptotic radiation, and is used to interpret prominent features
  of loud events.
