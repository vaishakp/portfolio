abstract: Using the exceptionally loud BBH event GW250114, the LVK Collaboration performs detailed
  inspiral–merger–ringdown tests of GR and black-hole spectroscopy of the remnant. The post-merger
  signal supports at least two quasi-normal modes, and the dominant mode and overtone are found
  consistent with Kerr predictions at the tens-of-percent level when analyzed at multiple post-peak
  times. A parameterized IMR analysis also constrains higher modes and bounds deviations of ringdown
  frequencies to the percent level, yielding single-event constraints comparable to—or stronger
  than—combined constraints from many O4 catalog events.
