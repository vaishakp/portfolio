summary: Studies chronology protection and causal pathologies in modified Kerr-Newman spacetimes.
abstract: The paper studies causality violation via closed timelike curves (CTCs) in Kerr–Newman
  and in two modified Kerr–Newman geometries (a noncommutative-inspired model and an f(R) modification).
  It quantifies the CTC region and shows that, in both modified models, parameters can be chosen
  so the causality-violating region disappears. The work also discusses geodesic connectivity
  of the would-be CTC region and comments on causal features of Kerr–Newman–(A)dS spacetimes.
