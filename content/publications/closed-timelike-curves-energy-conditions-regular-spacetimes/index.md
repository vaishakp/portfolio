summary: Explores chronology violation and energy conditions in regular spacetime models.
abstract: The authors investigate how violations of energy conditions relate to the presence of
  closed timelike curves in Kerr–Newman-type spacetimes. They introduce a correlation index that
  quantifies the overlap between CTC regions and energy-condition violations, and apply it to
  a regular noncommutative Kerr–Newman model to probe the local content of Hawking’s chronology
  protection conjecture. The results map out when (and how) energy-condition violations may help
  remove CTCs.
