summary: Investigation of the single-detector high-SNR event GW230814; includes targeted numerical
  relativity simulation support.
abstract: GW230814 is a very high–signal-to-noise BBH event observed primarily in the LIGO Livingston
  detector. The source parameters are consistent with a typical BBH (m₁≈34 M⊙, m₂≈28 M⊙) with
  near-zero effective spin, and the data enable the first confident inspiral detection of the
  ℓ=|m|=4 mode. A suite of GR consistency tests largely agrees with expectations; apparent ringdown
  deviations can be reproduced with GR-based simulations and realistic noise, underscoring the
  limitations of single-detector observations for robust fundamental-physics claims.
