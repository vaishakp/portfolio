summary: Quantifies tidal deformation of dynamical horizons and connects it to imprints on gravitational
  radiation.
abstract: Using NR simulations, this work tracks generalized source multipole moments of dynamical-horizon
  geometry through inspiral, merger, and ringdown. During inspiral the horizons steadily acquire
  multipoles that vanish for isolated holes, dominated by a quadrupole component, and these multipoles
  encode detailed binary dynamics. The dominant quadrupole moment is shown to correlate strongly
  with the gravitational field at future null infinity, implying a direct imprint on the emitted
  waves. After merger, multipoles of the common horizon inherit structure from the individual
  horizons and then decay as the remnant settles to equilibrium.
