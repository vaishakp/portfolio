summary: Science case for a lunar GW antenna; Vaishak authored the Testing GR section.
abstract: LGWA is a proposed array of next-generation inertial sensors on the Moon to measure
  lunar motion induced by gravitational waves. With sensitivity spanning roughly 1 mHz to 1 Hz,
  it would bridge the gap between space-based detectors such as LISA and future ground-based observatories
  like Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer. The paper lays out the mission concept and a comprehensive
  science case, including multimessenger opportunities and lunar-geophysics science enabled by
  the same data, and summarizes lunar characterization studies needed to plan the mission.
